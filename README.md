Introduction
As media companies and advertisers increasingly rely on cross-platform marketing strategies, it becomes essential to evaluate ad placements and effectiveness across multiple channels, including TV, streaming platforms, and social media. This system leverages AI-powered image recognition and video analytics to automate the detection, classification, and tracking of ads in real time.

Features
Multichannel Support: Analyze ads across multiple platforms including television, social media, and streaming services.
Ad Classification: Automatically classify ads into categories such as banner ads, sponsored content, pre-rolls, and more.
Image Recognition: Detect ads based on visual content using machine learning and deep neural networks.
Video Analytics: Track ad occurrences within videos, and log timestamps, formats, and frequencies.
Reporting: Generate detailed reports on ad performance and frequency.
Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python
Machine Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch
Computer Vision: OpenCV, YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection
Data Handling: NumPy, Pandas
Web Framework: Flask (for API integration)
Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly
Installation
To set up the Ad Classification system, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ad-classification.git
   cd ad-classification

2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download or prepare your ad classification dataset and organize it into folders.
4. Set up environment variables for API keys and model paths as needed.

Usage
Once the system is set up, you can start analyzing ads across your media channels.

1. Classifying Ads in Images:
   python classify_image.py --image_path <path-to-image>
2. Classifying Ads in Videos:
   python classify_video.py --video_path <path-to-video>
3.API Integration: The system can also be deployed as a web service using Flask. Start the Flask server using:python app.py
  python app.py

You can then send requests to the API to classify images and videos on-the-fly.

Model Training
If you want to retrain the models on your own dataset:

1. Organize your dataset into the appropriate format.
2. Update the config.py file to reflect your dataset path and other configurations.
3. Train the model
   python train_model.py

Dataset

The model was trained using a custom dataset of ad visuals collected from different media platforms. You can also use publicly available datasets or create your own by labeling images and videos containing ads.
